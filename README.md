# Fantasy Basketball Analytics

Advanced analytics toolkit for Yahoo Fantasy Basketball leagues. Automates data retrieval and provides comprehensive league-wide performance analysis beyond traditional head-to-head matchup results.

## Overview

This project reimagines fantasy basketball analytics by answering the question: **"How would my team perform against ALL teams in the league, not just my scheduled opponent?"**

Traditional fantasy basketball only shows your weekly matchup result (e.g., "you beat your opponent 6-3"). This toolkit provides a complete picture:
- How you would have performed against all 10 teams
- Your true strength independent of schedule luck
- Category-by-category league rankings
- Real-time mid-week scores and projections

Inspired by the "Possibility Matrix" Excel approach (see [info.md](info.md)), this Python implementation eliminates manual data entry and enables advanced analytics.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Week Analysis
- **Real-time matchup tracking** with mid-week category scores
- **Category rankings matrix** showing each team's rank (1-10) across all 9 stats
- **Strength/weakness identification** for strategic lineup and trade decisions

### ðŸ“Š League-Wide Comparisons
- View how every team performs against every other team
- Identify scheduling luck (winning/losing records that don't reflect true strength)
- Compare category competitiveness across the entire league

### ðŸ¤– Automated Data Pipeline
- Direct integration with Yahoo Fantasy Sports API
- No manual stat copying or data entry required
- Proper handling of FG% and FT% calculations (using FGM/FGA and FTM/FTA)

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Analytics (Planned)
- Historical performance tracking across multiple weeks
- Player-level contribution analysis
- Trade impact modeling
- Playoff matchup simulations

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Yahoo Fantasy Basketball league
- Yahoo Developer App credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/projects
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd FantasyBball
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Yahoo API credentials**

   a. Create a Yahoo Developer app:
   - Go to [Yahoo Developer Network](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create/)
   - Create a new app with "Fantasy Sports" API access
   - Note your **Client ID (Consumer Key)** and **Client Secret (Consumer Secret)**

   b. Configure credentials:
   ```bash
   cp oauth2.example.json oauth2.json
   # Edit oauth2.json and add your consumer_key and consumer_secret
   ```

5. **Authenticate with Yahoo**
   ```bash
   python -m src.auth
   ```
   This will open a browser for first-time OAuth authorization. Follow the prompts and paste the verification code back into the terminal.

6. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   python -m src.quick_test
   ```
   Should display your league ID(s).

---

## Usage

All scripts are run as Python modules from the project root:

```bash
python -m src.<script_name>
```

### Available Tools

#### Authentication & Setup
- **`src.auth`** - OAuth authentication helper (run once to authorize)
- **`src.quick_test`** - Verify API connection and list your leagues

#### Current Week Analysis
- **`src.show_matchups`** - Display all 5 matchups with mid-week category scores
- **`src.category_rankings`** - Generate 10Ã—9 rankings matrix showing each team's rank in all 9 stat categories

#### API Exploration (Development)
- **`src.explore_api`** - Inspect available API data structures
- **`src.api_capabilities`** - Test API method capabilities
- **`src.debug_matchups`** - Debug matchup data parsing

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Check current week's matchups
python -m src.show_matchups

# View league-wide category rankings
python -m src.category_rankings
```

## Fantasy Basketball Categories (9-CAT)

This project analyzes standard 9-category head-to-head leagues:

| Category | Name | Direction | Type |
|----------|------|-----------|------|
| **FG%** | Field Goal % | Higher wins | Ratio |
| **FT%** | Free Throw % | Higher wins | Ratio |
| **3PTM** | 3-Pointers Made | Higher wins | Counting |
| **PTS** | Points | Higher wins | Counting |
| **REB** | Rebounds | Higher wins | Counting |
| **AST** | Assists | Higher wins | Counting |
| **ST** | Steals | Higher wins | Counting |
| **BLK** | Blocks | Higher wins | Counting |
| **TO** | Turnovers | **Lower wins** | Counting |

Each head-to-head matchup awards one point per category won (max 9-0).

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest -q
```

### Adding New Analysis Tools
1. Create a new script in `src/`
2. Use existing helper functions (e.g., `parse_team_stats`, `get_team_name`)
3. Follow the module execution pattern: `if __name__ == '__main__': main()`

### API Rate Limits
- Yahoo Fantasy API has rate limits
- Consider caching data locally for historical analysis
- See `API_FINDINGS.md` for recommended query strategies
